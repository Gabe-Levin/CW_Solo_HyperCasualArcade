# CW_Solo_HyperCasualArcade
This is my solo project as part of the Codeworks software development program. We are given one week to complete a full-stack app. 

# Setup
To run this arcade locally simply clone the repo and run the follow
```
npm i
```
and then 
```
npm start
```
# Notes
This project doesn't have a backend and uses local storage to save the highscores. This makes deployment easy and the app very quick, but scores do not carry from one browser to another. Adding a database may be included in future releases.

# Special accknowledgements
